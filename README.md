# Machine Learning Web Application for Pneumonia Detection

/• Built and trained Machine Learning Model on Amazon SageMaker instances and studio, to predict Pneumonia Detection by training the model with the Image Classification Algorithm from AWS ECR. The model achieved an accuracy score of 82%.

/• Implemented a Lambda function and an API, both in AWS, to receive inputs from the users and return inferences predicted with the built Machine Learning Model

/• Implemented a users verification system with Amazon Cognito and used MongoDB for the storage of users

/• Implemented the application with React Native to request inferences and get the results of the Pneumonia
Detection

The data for the image training was obtained in kaggle.
